      when it comes to learning to code. We are building a peer study group for
      people who are teaching themselves how to code.

          The hard part of self-study is not finding the right information to
          learn, it's having the structure and accountability to keep you moving
          forward.

          Learning to code from the beginning won't be easy but we will provide
          you with peer support every step of the way. As long as you are
          committed to putting in the work, you will not get left behind.

          You shouldn't need to go broke to learn to code. Our membership fee is
          $20 per month (beta price) due the first week of the month.
