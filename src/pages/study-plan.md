## Aren't you repeating yourself?

Yes, we are and that's according to plan. We are choosing to work through highly rated Udemy courses together because the content is proven and validated. We expect to cover some topics more than once. Building using the concepts you learn and **spaced repetition** is a great way to solidify your knowledge.

We know these courses have worked for people. But each of the first four are taught by different instructors. Maybe one of them has a teaching style that really speaks to you in a way the others don't.

When we're honest with ourselves, we know that no one needs to buy another course. You don't even have to use Udemy to learn software development. There are really great free resources out there. Resources that are objectively better than what you get in some expensive bootcamps.

What is missing for the self-directed learner is the accountability and support system you get when you enroll in a bootcamp or coding school. That's what we're aiming to do with our study group. We are combining doing the work with a true support system for our members. 

This is hard stuff. It's almost impossible to do it alone. You don't have to.
