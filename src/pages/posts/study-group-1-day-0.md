We kicked off the study group yesterday just like we said we would. It got off to a bumpy start. The plan quickly gave way to the reality of implementing it. 

We decided to start with the HTML/CSS crash course on https://scrimba.com. We thought we'd watch the videos together and work through at the same time. That wasn't a great experience, so I proposed we do some parallel coding. Mute for half an hour, get to work independently, then check in with the group.

Unfortunately, I didn't attend the rest of the session. I haven't seen the recording yet. But I know things went less than smoothly in our first session.

Can I tell you how excited I am about that? We did the thing, some of the thing didn't work and we're adjusting it until it does. 

I'm so grateful for everyone who logged on to participate yesterday. I'm especially grateful to Nee because she keeps me grounded when I want to run off in a million directions. And she speaks up about how things feel from a beginner-beginner perspective.
